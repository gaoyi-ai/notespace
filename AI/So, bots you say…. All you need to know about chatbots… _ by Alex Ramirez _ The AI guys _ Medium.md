**So, bots you sayâ€¦**
=====================

All you need to know about chatbots (and not die trying)
--------------------------------------------------------

It is very likely that youâ€™ve heard all the buzz that has been going lately about the _chatbots,_ and how theyâ€™re going to revolutionize everything in the coming years, but if you havenâ€™t, let me guide you through the revolution.

**Well, fear no more, dear reader, this is (_part one of_) all you need to know about chatbots.**

Whatâ€™s a bot?
=============

In general terms, a _bot_ is a piece of software that automates a task, but talking specifically about chatbots, we come to the concept of automating an interaction through a conversational UI.

But donâ€™t mind my fancy wording. Chatbots are a way in which you can automate a written conversation, simulating an interaction between two real human beings. (Even though most of the times chatbots have superpowers).

Think of it as a magical black box that understands what you tell it with your daily English (or Spanish, or German, or Mandarin, or whatever) and answers you in the same language, and not in a stream of ones and zeros.

Sounds great, right? ðŸ¦„

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/964/1*0xCh-KPhMa36hWRCzfazlg.png)Well, technically is not blackâ€¦

But that black box is not black after all. Itâ€™s most likely some sort of state machine or automaton, processing the input it received; and of course is not magic (sorry to break the spell): itâ€™s one subset of Artificial Intelligence called **Natural Language Processing** (or NLP).

NLP, where have I heard that before..?
======================================

Nope. Is not Neuro-Linguistic Programming. Have you used Siri? I know you have. Google Now? Cortana? Alexa?

Great. Well, all of the above use something called **Natural Language Processing**.

> Since at least the days of Hal 9000 and early Star Trek, the computer of the future was supposed to be able to understand what people wanted, when expressed in ordinary language and not programming code. Computer scientists have been working on this capability, called natural language processing (NLP), for decades.

Basically, NLP gives a computer the ability to understand what people says and translate it into pieces of code it can use to do some processing.

But how does it work, you might be wondering?

To try to understand the language, the NLP uses some of the most renowned AI models, such as Neural Networks, Deep Learning techniques, or Classifiers. (Stanfordâ€™s Classifier is one of the most popular ones around).

But it has been [proven](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224396640_The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Data) that, even with the most sophisticated algorithms, the key element to get a good language processing and understanding is **data**. Having a large dataset can provide better results than a State-of-the-art algorithm, and that is a problem of **Statistics**. So, NLP is an interdisciplinary field that requires computer scientists, linguists (no need to explain why), and mathematicians.

The Natural Language Processing is a huge field of study, which Iâ€™ll cover in detail later in the series, but for now, letâ€™s move on.

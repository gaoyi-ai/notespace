**Advantages of Bresenham Line Drawing Algorithm-**
---------------------------------------------------

The advantages of Bresenham Line Drawing Algorithm are-

*   It is easy to implement.
*   It is fast and incremental.
*   It executes fast but less faster than DDA Algorithm.
*   The points generated by this algorithm are more accurate than DDA Algorithm.
*   It uses fixed points only.

**Disadvantages of Bresenham Line Drawing Algorithm-**
------------------------------------------------------

The disadvantages of Bresenham Line Drawing Algorithm are-

*   Though it improves the accuracy of generated points but still the resulted line is not smooth.
*   This algorithm is for the basic line drawing.
*   It can not handle diminishing jaggies.

# Computer Graphic Rendering - gentle explain

Walk into a darkened room and turn on the lights. The gleam of furniture, the color and texture of carpets and curtains are instantly visible. A simple everyday act-but the science behind it is a complex and increasingly important part of materials design and manufacturing. Light from a light source hits a surface and part of it is scattered and transmitted to your eyes. The visual perception of an object- what we call its appearance arises from the interaction of incident light with the object's surface geometry or texture. Optical properties of the material (such as index of refraction or polarization) also play a very important role. Will there come a day when given the microstructural and optical properties of a material a computer program can create the image of a chair made with that material? Making that day a reality will depend on the outcome of research done today.

走进一个黑暗的房间，打开灯。 家具的光泽、地毯和窗帘的颜色和质地都一目了然。 一个简单的日常行为——但其背后的科学是材料设计和制造中一个复杂且日益重要的部分。 来自光源的光照射到表面，其中一部分被散射并传输到您的眼睛。 物体的视觉感知——我们称之为外观的东西来自入射光与物体表面几何形状或纹理的相互作用。 材料的光学特性（例如折射率或偏振）也起着非常重要的作用。 考虑到一种材料的微观结构和光学特性，计算机程序会创建出用这种材料制成的椅子的图像吗？ 使这一天成为现实将取决于今天所做的研究结果。

For some years computer programs have produced images of scenes based on a simulation of scattering and reflection of light off one or more surfaces. In response to increasing demand for the use of rendering in design and manufacturing, the models used in these programs have undergone intense research in the computer graphics community. In particular, more physically realistic models are sought (i.e. models that more accurately depict the physics of light interaction).

多年来，计算机程序已经基于对光从一个或多个表面的散射和反射的模拟来生成场景图像。 为了响应在设计和制造中使用渲染的日益增长的需求，这些程序中使用的模型已经在计算机图形界进行了深入的研究。 特别是，寻求更真实的物理模型（即更准确地描述光相互作用物理的模型）。

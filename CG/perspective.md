# perspective

Perspective works by representing the light that passes from a scene through an imaginary rectangle (realized as the plane of the painting), to the viewer's eye, as if a viewer were looking through a window and painting what is seen directly onto the windowpane. If viewed from the same spot as the windowpane was painted, the painted image would be identical to what was seen through the unpainted window. Each painted object in the scene is thus a flat, scaled down version of the object on the other side of the window.[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)#cite_note-4) Because each portion of the painted object lies on the straight line from the viewer's eye to the equivalent portion of the real object it represents, the viewer sees no difference (sans [depth perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_perception)) between the painted scene on the windowpane and the view of the real scene. All perspective drawings assume the viewer is a certain distance away from the drawing. Objects are scaled relative to that viewer. An object is often not scaled evenly: a circle often appears as an ellipse and a square can appear as a trapezoid. This distortion is referred to as **foreshortening**.

透视的工作原理是将光线从场景中穿过一个假想的矩形（实现为绘画的平面），到达观察者的眼睛，就好像观察者正在透过窗户看，并将看到的东西直接画在窗玻璃上。如果从与窗玻璃上漆的同一地点观看，上漆的图像将与通过未上漆的窗户看到的相同。因此，场景中的每个绘制对象都是窗口另一侧对象的平面缩小版本。因为绘制对象的每个部分都位于从观看者的眼睛到它所代表的真实物体的等效部分的直线上，所以观看者看不到任何区别（无[深度知觉](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_perception)）。在窗玻璃上绘制的场景和真实场景的视图之间。所有透视图都假定观察者与图有一定的距离。对象相对于该查看器进行缩放。对象的缩放比例通常不均匀：圆形通常显示为椭圆，而正方形显示为梯形。这种失真被称为**透视缩短**。

Perspective drawings have a horizon line, which is often implied. This line, directly opposite the viewer's eye, represents objects infinitely far away. They have shrunk, in the distance, to the infinitesimal thickness of a line. It is analogous to (and named after) the Earth's [horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon).

透视图有一条地平线，这通常是隐含的。 这条线直接与观察者的眼睛相对，代表无限远的物体。 在远处，它们已经缩小到一条线的极小粗细。 它类似于（并以其命名）地球的[地平线](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon)。

Any perspective representation of a scene that includes parallel lines has one or more [vanishing points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_point) in a perspective drawing. A one-point perspective drawing means that the drawing has a single vanishing point, usually (though not necessarily) directly opposite the viewer's eye and usually (though not necessarily) on the horizon line. All lines parallel with the viewer's line of sight recede to the horizon towards this vanishing point. This is the standard "receding railroad tracks" phenomenon. A two-point drawing would have lines parallel to two different [angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle). Any number of vanishing points are possible in a drawing, one for each set of parallel lines that are at an angle relative to the plane of the drawing.

# One-point perspective

A drawing has one-point perspective when it contains only one vanishing point on the horizon line. This type of perspective is typically used for images of roads, railway tracks, hallways, or buildings viewed so that the front is directly facing the viewer. Any objects that are made up of lines either directly parallel with the viewer's line of sight or directly perpendicular (the railroad ties/sleepers) can be represented with one-point perspective. These parallel lines converge at the vanishing point.

One-point perspective exists when the [picture plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_plane) is parallel to two axes of a rectilinear (or Cartesian) scene—a scene which is composed entirely of linear elements that intersect only at right angles. If one axis is parallel with the picture plane, then all elements are either parallel to the picture plane (either horizontally or vertically) or perpendicular to it. All elements that are parallel to the picture plane are drawn as parallel lines. All elements that are perpendicular to the picture plane converge at a single point (a vanishing point) on the horizon.

# Two-point perspective

A drawing has two-point perspective when it contains two vanishing points on the horizon line. In an illustration, these vanishing points can be placed arbitrarily along the horizon. Two-point perspective can be used to draw the same objects as one-point perspective, rotated: looking at the corner of a house, or at two forked roads shrinking into the distance, for example. One point represents one set of [parallel lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines), the other point represents the other. Seen from the corner, one wall of a house would recede towards one vanishing point while the other wall recedes towards the opposite vanishing point.

Two-point perspective exists when the picture plane is parallel to a Cartesian scene in one axis (usually the [z-axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-axis)) but not to the other two axes. If the scene being viewed consists solely of a cylinder sitting on a horizontal plane, no difference exists in the image of the cylinder between a one-point and two-point perspective.

Two-point perspective has one set of lines parallel to the picture plane and two sets oblique to it. Parallel lines oblique to the picture plane converge to a vanishing point, which means that this set-up will require two vanishing points.

# Three-point perspective

Three-point perspective is often used for buildings seen from above (or below). In addition to the two vanishing points from before, one for each wall, there is now one for how the vertical lines of the walls recede. For an object seen from above, this third vanishing point is below the ground. For an object seen from below, as when the viewer looks up at a tall building, the third vanishing point is high in space.

Three-point perspective exists when the perspective is a view of a Cartesian scene where the picture plane is not parallel to any of the scene's three axes. Each of the three vanishing points corresponds with one of the three axes of the scene. One, two and three-point perspectives appear to embody different forms of calculated perspective, and are generated by different methods. Mathematically, however, all three are identical; the difference is merely in the relative orientation of the rectilinear scene to the viewer.

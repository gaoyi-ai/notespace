Homography, also referred to as planar homography, is a transformation that is occurring between two planes. In other words, it is a mapping between two planar projections of an image. It is represented by a 3x3 transformation matrix in a homogenous coordinates space. Mathematically, the homograohy matrix is represented as:

How does this look like in a coordinate plane?

As observed in the illustration, the element in an image has its projection to the other image in a homogenous coordinate plane, retaining the same information but in a transformed perspective.

# Homography

> [Homography Transform â€” Image Processing | by Matt Maulion | Medium](https://mattmaulion.medium.com/homography-transform-image-processing-eddbcb8e4ff7)

Homography, also referred to as planar homography, is a transformation that is occurring between two planes. In other words, it is a mapping between two planar projections of an image. It is represented by a 3x3 transformation matrix in a homogenous coordinates space. Mathematically, the homograohy matrix is represented as:

How does this look like in a coordinate plane?

As observed in the illustration, the element in an image has its projection to the other image in a homogenous coordinate plane, retaining the same information but in a transformed perspective.

- General definition:

    A homography is a non-singular, line preserving, projective mapping $\mathrm{h}: \mathrm{P}^{\mathrm{n}} \rightarrow \mathrm{P}^{\mathrm{n}}$.
    It is represented by a square $(n+1)$-dimension matrix with $(n+1)^{2}-1$ DOF

- Note: homographies are not restricted to $\mathrm{P}^{2}$

- Homography = projective transformation = projectivity = collineation 

    > collineation  (a mathematical transformation in which [collinear](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/collinear) elements (as points or lines) are transferred as corresponding elements to another plane or space)
    >
    > Given a collineation $F$ and a line $L$, we can fix distinct points $p$ and $q$ on $L$, and since $F$ is a bijection, $p^{\prime}=F^{-1}(p)$ and $q^{\prime}=F^{-1}(q)$ are distinct. Let $L^{\prime}$ be the line through $p^{\prime}$ and $q^{\prime}$. Then $F\left[L^{\prime}\right]$ is a line through $p$ and $q$, so it must be $L$. This shows that $F$ is surjective on lines. It is clear that $F$ is also injective on lines, so it is bijective, which is equivalent to the remark as noted.

What is a Laplace Distribution?
-------------------------------

The Laplace distribution, one of the earliest known probability distributions, is a continuous probability distribution named after the French mathematician [Pierre-Simon Laplace](http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Laplace.html). Like the [normal distribution](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/normal-distributions/), this distribution is [unimodal](https://www.statisticshowto.com/unimodal-distribution-2/) (one [peak](https://www.statisticshowto.com/peak-of-a-distribution/)) and [symmetrical](https://www.statisticshowto.com/symmetric-distribution-2/). However, it has a sharper peak than the normal distribution.

The Laplace distribution is the distribution of the difference of two independent [random variables](https://www.statisticshowto.com/random-variable/) with identical exponential distributions (Leemis, n.d.). It is often used to model phenomena with [heavy tails](https://www.statisticshowto.com/heavy-tailed-distribution/) or when data has a higher peak than the normal distribution.

This distribution is the result of two [exponential distributions](https://www.statisticshowto.com/exponential-distribution/), one positive and one negative; It is sometimes called the **double exponential distribution,** because it looks like two exponential distributions spliced together back-to-back.

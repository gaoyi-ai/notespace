Convention is at the heart of Maven. Convention over configuration is a popular aphorism these days, and Maven fully embraces this concept. Convention over configuration is at the central philosophy of frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, and more recently, the EJB3 specification. In its most basic sense it means that, while configuration is certainly necessary, the majority of users will never utilize such edge-cases those complex configurations provide. Although a powerful framework certainly needs to have the power to configure when necessary, it is certainly reasonable to create defaults to allow the 95% of similar use-cases to work without defining anything at all... the system can assume these defaults. In other words, the system has its own convention. Because of this, the monstrous configurations required of build tools like Ant (where a majority of Ant scripts are cut-and-pasted from existing projects) are non-existent for those projects that follow Maven's conventions.

Another driving force behind the popularity of convention over configuration is the speed at which new users may pick up a new technology, or the speed by which a seasoned user may begin using the tool without concerning him/herself with details that need not come up until later in the development process. The computer world is finally beginning to embrace the idea that ease of use and reduced configurations do not have to interfere with the power of advanced configurability. Convention and configuration reside together within the Maven world, each providing their own unique perspective of a power tool.

惯例是Maven的核心。惯例大于配置是最近很流行的一句格言，而Maven完全接受了这个概念。惯例大于配置是Ruby on Rails等框架以及最近的EJB3规范的核心理念。在最基本的意义上，它意味着，虽然配置肯定是必要的，但大多数用户永远不会利用那些复杂配置提供的这种边缘情况。虽然一个强大的框架当然需要在必要的时候拥有配置的能力，但是创建默认值来让95%的类似用例在完全不需要定义任何东西的情况下就可以工作，这当然是合理的......系统可以承担这些默认值。换句话说，系统有自己的约定。正因为如此，对于那些遵循Maven惯例的项目来说，像Ant这样的构建工具所需要的庞大配置（其中大部分Ant脚本都是从现有项目中剪切和粘贴过来的）是不存在的。

惯例比配置更受欢迎的另一个驱动力是新用户学习新技术的速度，或者是老用户开始使用工具的速度，而不需要关心那些在开发过程中不需要出现的细节。计算机世界终于开始接受这样的观点，即易用性和减少配置不一定要影响先进的配置能力。约定和配置在Maven世界中共存，各自提供了自己独特的视角的有力工具。

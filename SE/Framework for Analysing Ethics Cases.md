# Framework for Analysing Ethics Cases

> This excerpt was take from: Sara Baase (2003), A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal and Ethical Issues for Computers and the Internet, Prentice Hall

How shall we analyze specific scenarios? We now have a number of tools. We can try to apply our favorite ethical theory, or some combination of the theories. We can ask questions that reflect basic ethical values: Is it honest? Is it responsible? Does it violate an agreement we made? We can consult a code of professional ethics. But ethical theories and guidelines might conflict, or we might find no clause in the Codes specifically applicable. The Preamble of the Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice, recognizes this problem and emphasizes the need for good judgment and concern for the safety, health, and welfare of the public. Although we [ may ] not follow the outline below step by step, [ … ] discussions of the cases will usually include most of these elements:

具体场景如何分析？ 我们现在有很多工具。 我们可以尝试应用我们最喜欢的伦理理论，或者这些理论的某种组合。 我们可以提出反映基本道德价值观的问题：诚实吗？ 是否负责？ 它是否违反了我们达成的协议？ 我们可以查阅职业道德守则。 但是道德理论和指导方针可能会发生冲突，或者我们可能会发现守则中没有特别适用的条款。 软件工程道德和专业实践守则的序言承认了这个问题，并强调了对公众安全、健康和福利的良好判断和关注的必要性。 尽管我们[可能]不会一步一步地遵循下面的大纲，[……]案例的讨论通常会包括其中的大部分内容：

1. **Brainstorming phase**
  - List risks, issues, problems, consequences.
  - List all the people and organizations affected. (They are generally referred to as the stakeholders.)
  - In cases where there is not a simple yes-or-no decision, but rather one has co choose some action, list possible actions.
2. **Analysis phase**
  - Identify responsibilities of the decision maker. (Consider responsibilities of both general ethics and professional ethics.)
      明确决策者的职责。 （考虑一般道德和职业道德的责任。）
  - Identify rights of stakeholders. (It might be helpful to clarify whether they are
      negative or positive rights.)
      确定利益相关者的权利。 （澄清它们是消极权利还是积极权利可能会有所帮助。）
  - Consider the impact of the action options on the stakeholders. Analyze consequences, risks, benefits, harms, costs for each action considered.
      考虑行动选项对利益相关者的影响。 分析考虑的每项行动的后果、风险、收益、危害和成本。
  - Find sections of the Software Engineering Code or the ACM Code that apply. [ … ] Consider Kant's and Mill's approaches. Then, categorize each potential action or response as ethically obligatory, ethically prohibited, or ethically acceptable.
      查找适用的软件工程代码或 ACM 代码部分。 [ ... ] 考虑康德和密尔的方法。 然后，将每个潜在的行动或反应归类为道德义务、道德禁止或道德可接受。
  - If there are several ethically acceptable options, select an option, considering the ethical merits of each, courtesy to others, practicality, self-interest, personal preferences, and so on. (In some cases, plan a sequence of actions, depending on the response to each.)
      如果有几个道德上可接受的选项，请选择一个选项，考虑每个选项的道德优点、对他人的礼貌、实用性、自身利益、个人偏好等。 （在某些情况下，根据对每个行动的反应，计划一系列行动。）

The brainstorming phase can generate a long discussion with humorous and obviously wrong options. In the analysis phase, we might reject some options or decide that the claims of some stakeholders are irrelevant or minor. The brainstorming effort in generating these ideas was not wasted. It could bring out ethical and practical considerations and ocher useful ideas that one would not immediately think of. And it is as helpful to know why some factors do not carry heavy ethical weight as it is to know which ones do.

头脑风暴阶段可以产生带有幽默和明显错误选项的长时间讨论。 在分析阶段，我们可能会拒绝某些选项或决定某些利益相关者的主张无关紧要或次要。 产生这些想法的头脑风暴并没有浪费。 它可以带来道德和实践方面的考虑以及人们不会立即想到的赭石有用的想法。 了解为什么某些因素没有重大的道德分量与了解哪些因素具有重要的道德分量一样有帮助。

Introduction to Activity Based Costing
--------------------------------------

Activity based costing (ABC) assigns manufacturing overhead costs to products in a more logical manner than the traditional approach of simply allocating costs on the basis of machine hours. Activity based costing first assigns costs to the activities that are the real cause of the overhead. It then assigns the cost of those activities only to the products that are actually demanding the activities.

Let's discuss activity based costing by looking at two products manufactured by the same company. Product 124 is a low volume item which requires certain activities such as special engineering, additional testing, and many machine setups because it is ordered in small quantities. A similar product, Product 366, is a high volume product—running continuously—and requires little attention and no special activities. If this company used traditional costing, it might allocate or"spread"all of its overhead to products based on the number of machine hours. This will result in little overhead cost allocated to Product 124, because it did not have many machine hours. However, it did demand lots of engineering, testing, and setup activities. In contrast, Product 366 will be allocated an enormous amount of overhead (due to all those machine hours), but it demanded little overhead activity. The result will be a miscalculation of each product's true cost of manufacturing overhead. Activity based costing will overcome this shortcoming by assigning overhead on more than the one activity, running the machine.

Activity based costing recognizes that the special engineering, special testing, machine setups, and others are activities that cause costs—they cause the company to consume resources. Under ABC, the company will calculate the cost of the resources used in each of these activities. Next, the cost of each of these activities will be assigned only to the products that demanded the activities. In our example, Product 124 will be assigned some of the company's costs of special engineering, special testing, and machine setup. Other products that use any of these activities will also be assigned some of their costs. Product 366 will not be assigned any cost of special engineering or special testing, and it will be assigned only a small amount of machine setup.

Activity based costing has grown in importance in recent decades because (1) manufacturing overhead costs have increased significantly, (2) the manufacturing overhead costs no longer correlate with the productive machine hours or direct labor hours, (3) the diversity of products and the diversity in customers' demands have grown, and (4) some products are produced in large batches, while others are produced in small batches.

ABC比传统的以机器工作时间为基础简单地分摊制造间接费用的方法更有逻辑地将制造间接费用分配给产品。ABC首先将成本分配到造成间接费用的实际作业上。然后，它只将这些活动的成本分配给实际需要这些活动的产品。

让我们以同一家公司生产的两种产品为例来讨论ABC。产品124是一个小批量产品，它需要某些活动，如特殊工程、附加测试和许多机器设置，因为它是小批量订购的。类似的产品product 366是一个高容量产品——连续运行——并且不需要特别注意，也不需要特别的活动。如果该公司使用传统成本计算方法，它可能会根据机器小时数分配或“分散”其所有开销到产品上。这将导致分配给产品124的管理费用很少，因为它没有很多机器时间。然而，它确实需要大量的工程、测试和设置活动。相比之下，产品366将被分配大量的开销(由于所有这些机器时间)，但是它只需要很少的开销活动。其结果将是对每个产品的实际制造费用的错误计算。基于作业的成本计算将克服这一缺点，将开销分配给多个作业，运行机器。

基于作业的成本计算认识到特殊的工程，特殊的测试，机器设置和其他活动是导致成本的活动-他们导致公司消耗资源。根据ABC，公司应计算用于每一项活动的资源成本。接下来，每个活动的成本将只分配给需要这些活动的产品。在我们的示例中，将为产品124分配一些公司的特殊工程、特殊测试和机器设置成本。其他使用这些活动的产品也将被分配一些成本。产品366不会被分配任何特殊工程或特殊测试的费用，它只被分配少量的机器安装费用。

基于作业的成本计算在最近几十年变得越来越重要，因为(1)制造间接费用显著增加，(2)制造间接费用不再与生产机器时间或直接人工时间相关，(3)产品的多样性和客户需求的多样性已经增加，(4)有些产品是大批量生产的，而有些产品是小批量生产的。

Activity Based Costing with Two Activities
------------------------------------------

Let's illustrate the concept of activity based costing by looking at two common manufacturing activities: (1) the setting up of a production machine for running batches of products, and (2) the actual production of the units of product.

We will assume that a company has annual manufacturing overhead costs of $2,000,000—of which $200,000 is directly involved in setting up the production machines. During the year the company expects to perform 400 machine setups. Let's also assume that the **[batch sizes](https://www.accountingcoach.com/terms/B/batch-size)** vary considerably, but the setup efforts for each machine are similar.

The cost per setup is calculated to be $500 ($200,000 of cost per year divided by 400 setups per year). Under activity based costing, \$200,000 of the overhead will be viewed as a **[batch-level cost](https://www.accountingcoach.com/terms/B/batch-level-cost)**. This means that \$200,000 will first be allocated to batches of products to be manufactured (referred to as a **[Stage 1 allocation](https://www.accountingcoach.com/terms/S/stage-one-allocation)**), and then be assigned to the units of product in each batch (referred to as **[Stage 2 allocation](https://www.accountingcoach.com/terms/S/stage-two-allocation)**). For example, if Batch X consists of 5,000 units of product, the setup cost per unit is \$0.10 (\$500 divided by 5,000 units). If Batch Y is 50,000 units, the cost per unit for setup will be \$0.01 (\$500 divided by 50,000 units). For simplicity, let's assume that the remaining \$1,800,000 of manufacturing overhead is caused by the production activities that correlate with the company's 100,000 machine hours.

让我们通过看两种常见的制造活动来说明作业成本法的概念:(1)为运行批量产品设置生产机器，和(2)产品单位的实际生产。

我们假设一家公司每年的制造间接成本为200万美元，其中20万美元直接涉及安装生产机器。在这一年中，该公司预计将安装400台机器。我们还假设**[批大小](https://www.accountingcoach.com/terms/B/batch-size)**差异很大，但每台机器的设置工作是相似的。

每个设置的成本计算为500美元(每年20万美元的成本除以每年400个设置)。在作业成本法下，200,000美元的间接费用将被视为[批量成本](https://www.accountingcoach.com/terms/B/batch-level-cost)**。这意味着\$200,000将首先分配给要生产的产品批次(称为**[第一阶段分配](https://www.accountingcoach.com/terms/S/stage-one-allocation)**)，然后分配到每批产品的单位(参见**[阶段2分配](https://www.accountingcoach.com/terms/S/stage-two-allocation)**)。例如，如果批X包含5,000个单位的产品，每个单位的设置成本为\$0.10(\$500除以5,000个单位)。如果批Y是50,000个单位，每个单位的设置成本将是\$0.01(\$500除以50,000个单位)。为简单起见，我们假设剩余的180万美元的制造费用是由与公司的10万机器小时相关的生产活动引起的。

For our simple two-activity example, let's see how the rates for allocating the manufacturing overhead would look _with_ activity based costing and _without_ activity based costing:

Next, let's see what impact these different allocation techniques and overhead rates would have on the per unit cost of a specific unit of output. Assume that a company manufactures a batch of **5,000** units and it produces 50 units per machine hour, here is how the cost assigned to the units with activity based costing and without activity based costing compares:

[![](https://www.accountingcoach.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/35X-table-02.png)](https://www.accountingcoach.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/35X-table-02@2x.png)

If a company manufactures a batch of **50,000** units and produces 50 units per machine hour, here is how the cost assigned to the units with ABC and without ABC compares:

[![](https://www.accountingcoach.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/35X-table-03.png)](https://www.accountingcoach.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/35X-table-03@2x.png)

As the tables above illustrate, with activity based costing the cost per unit decreases from $0.46 to $0.37 because the cost of the setup activity is spread over 50,000 units instead of 5,000 units. Without ABC, the cost per unit is \$0.40 regardless of the number of units in each batch. If companies base their selling prices on costs, a company _not_ using an ABC approach might lose the large batch work to a competitor who bids a lower price based on the lower, _more accurate_ overhead cost of ​\$0.37. It's also possible that a company not using ABC may find itself being the low bidder for manufacturing small batches of product, since its \$0.40 is lower than the ABC model of \$0.46 for a batch size of 5,000 units. With its bid price based on manufacturing overhead of \$0.40—but a true cost of \$0.46—the company may end up doing lots of production for little or no profit.

Our example with just two activities (production and setup) illustrates how the cost per unit using the activity based costing method is more accurate in reflecting the actual efforts associated with production. As companies began measuring the costs of activities (instead of focusing on the accountant's departmental classifications), they began using ABC cost information to practice **[activity based management](https://www.accountingcoach.com/terms/A/activity-based-management)**. For example, with the cost of setting up a machine now being measured and discussed, managers began to ask questions such as:

> _Why is the cost of setting up a production machine so expensive?  
> What can be done to reduce the setup cost?  
> If the setup costs cannot be reduced, are the selling prices adequate to cover all of the company's costs—including the setup cost that was previously buried in the overall machine-hour overhead rate?_

[Pricing products](https://www.patriotsoftware.com/blog/accounting/how-to-price-a-product/) or services is one of the difficult decisions that can either make or break your business. You want to price high enough so you can grow your company with a decent profit margin, but your prices also need to be competitive to get customers through the door.

Many large businesses, particularly in the manufacturing sector, use activity-based costing to help them accurately price their offerings. But, small businesses can also benefit from using this costing method.

Activity-based costing is a complex subject. Learn the basics of what activity-based costing is, how to find it, and how it can help your business.

What is activity-based costing?
-------------------------------

The activity-based costing (ABC) system is a method of accounting you can use to find the total cost of activities necessary to make a product. The ABC system assigns costs to each activity that goes into production, such as workers testing a product.

Many businesses use the cost of goods sold (COGS) to determine how much it costs to create a product. But, COGS focuses on direct costs and does not include indirect expenses like overhead.

Some businesses take their overhead expenses and allocate them evenly among all products. But because some products use more overhead expenses than others, the cost of making each product is inaccurate under this method.

With activity-based costing, you take into consideration both the direct and [overhead costs](https://www.patriotsoftware.com/blog/accounting/understanding-overhead-expenses/) of creating each product. You recognize that different products require different indirect expenses. By assigning both direct and overhead expenses to each product, you can more accurately set prices. And, the activity-based costing process shows you which overhead costs you might be able to cut back on.

For example, you make soap. Soap A requires more overhead, like testing, than Soap B. Using activity-based costing, you assign the right overhead costs to the appropriate products. That way, your overhead is higher for Soap A than B.

许多企业使用销货成本(COGS)来确定生产一种产品的成本。但是，销货成本主要关注直接成本，不包括间接费用，如管理费用。

有些企业把管理费平均分配到所有产品上。但由于某些产品比其他产品使用更多的管理费用，在这种方法下，每个产品的生产成本是不准确的。

使用作业成本法，你要同时考虑创建每个产品的直接成本和[间接成本](https://www.patriotsoftware.com/blog/accounting/understanding-overhead-expenses/)。你知道不同的产品需要不同的间接费用。通过为每个产品分配直接和间接费用，您可以更准确地设定价格。而且，作业成本法会告诉你哪些间接费用可以削减。

例如，你制作肥皂。Soap A比Soap b需要更多的开销(如测试)。使用基于作业的成本计算，您将正确的开销分配给适当的产品。这样，您的Soap A的开销就比Soap B高。

Activity-based costing steps
----------------------------

To use activity-based costing, you must understand the process for assigning costs to activities.

First, identify which activities are necessary to create a product.

Then, separate each activity into its own cost pool, which is a group of individual costs associated with an activity. Determine the total overhead of each cost pool. For example, purchasing could be its own cost pool.

Next, assign activity cost drivers to each cost pool. Cost drivers are things (e.g., units, hours, parts, etc.) that control the changes in costs. For example, purchasing costs are driven by the number of parts purchased.

Divide the total overhead in each cost pool by the total cost drivers to get your cost driver rate.

Lastly, compute how many hours, parts, units, etc. that the activity used and multiply it by the cost driver rate.

ABC systems can be complicated. Check out this example to help further illustrate the process.

要使用基于作业的成本计算，您必须了解将成本分配给作业的过程。

首先，确定哪些活动是创建产品所必需的。

然后，将每一项活动分离成它自己的成本池，这是一组与某项活动相关的单个成本。确定每个成本池的总开销。例如，采购可以是它自己的成本池。

接下来，将作业成本动因分配到每个成本池。成本动因是控制成本变化的因素(如单位、小时、部件等)。例如，采购成本是由购买的零件数量决定的。

将每个成本池中的总间接费用除以总成本动因，得到成本动因率。

最后，计算作业使用的小时数、零件数、单位数等，并将其乘以成本驱动率。

ABC系统可能很复杂。查看这个示例，以帮助进一步说明这个过程。

### Example

Let’s figure out how much you are spending on utilities to create a product. To do this, you estimate that your total utility bill is $20,000 for the year.

You determine that the cost driver impacting your utility bill is the number of direct labor hours worked. The number of direct labor hours worked totaled 1,000 hours for the year.

Divide your total utility bill by your cost driver (the number of hours worked) to get your cost driver rate. Your overhead application rate is $20 ($20,000 / 1,000 hours).

For this particular product, you used utilities for 3 hours. Multiply the hours by the cost driver rate of \$20 to get $60.

让我们来计算一下为了创造一种产品，你在公共设施上花了多少钱。要做到这一点，你估计你一年的总水电费是2万美元。

您确定影响您的公用事业账单的成本驱动因素是直接工作的人工小时数。全年的直接劳动时数为1000小时。

将你的总电费除以你的成本驱动因素(工作小时数)得到你的成本驱动率。您的开销申请费率是$20($20,000 / 1,000小时)。

对于这个特定的产品，您使用了3个小时的实用程序。将工时乘以20美元的成本驱动率，得到60美元。

How to use the ABC system
-------------------------

Because activity-based costing breaks down the costs that go into creating a product, it has many uses in business.

For small businesses, activity-based costing is great for making overhead decisions and pricing products.

因为基于作业的成本法分解了创建产品的成本，所以它在商业中有很多用途。

对于小型企业来说，作业成本法在制定日常开支决策和产品定价方面非常有效。

### Overhead decisions

The ABC system shows you how overhead is used, which helps you determine whether certain activities are necessary for production.

If you find that some activities cost more than they should, you can find new methods to do something. Or, you can cut out steps entirely.

ABC系统向您显示开销是如何使用的，这有助于您确定某些活动是否为生产所必需。

如果你发现有些活动的成本超出了应有的水平，你可以找到做某事的新方法。或者，你可以完全省去步骤。

### Product pricing

The specific allocation of costs also helps you set prices that produce a healthy [small business profit margin](https://www.patriotsoftware.com/blog/accounting/how-do-you-determine-a-profit-margin/). If you only know which direct costs go into your products, you are ignoring the other costs, which could lessen your profit margins.

With an ABC system, you can assign costs to each activity in the production process, allowing you to more accurately set a price that accounts for how much it costs you to create a product.

成本的具体分配也可以帮助你制定价格，产生一个健康的[小企业利润](https://www.patriotsoftware.com/blog/accounting/how-do-you-determine-a-profit-margin/)。如果你只知道产品的直接成本，你就忽略了其他成本，这会降低你的利润率。

使用ABC系统，您可以将成本分配给生产过程中的每个活动，使您能够更准确地设定一个价格，计算出创建一种产品的成本。

# The activity-based costing process

ABC focuses attention on cost drivers, the activities that cause costs to increase. Traditional absorption costing tends to focus on volume-related drivers, such as labour hours, while activity-based costing also uses transaction-based drivers, such as number of orders received. In this way, long-term variable overheads, traditionally considered fixed costs, can be traced to products.

ABC关注成本动因，即导致成本增加的活动。传统的吸收成本法倾向于关注与数量相关的驱动因素，如工时，而ABC也使用基于事务的驱动因素，如收到的订单数量。这样，传统上被认为是固定成本的长期可变经常性开支就可以追溯到产品。

A Stakeholder Engagement Plan is a formal strategy to communicate with project stakeholders to achieve their support for the project.

It specifies the frequency and type of communications, media, contact persons, and locations of communication events.  It is created at the beginning of the project and updated frequently as stakeholder communication needs change.

The [Project Management Body of Knowledge](https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards) (PMBOK) specifies the creation of a _Stakeholder Engagement Plan_ as part of the Plan Stakeholder Engagement Process within the [Project Stakeholder Management](https://www.projectengineer.net/project-stakeholder-management-according-to-the-pmbok/) knowledge area.

Parts of a Stakeholder Engagement Plan
--------------------------------------

A good stakeholder engagement plan contains the following parts:

*   **Stakeholder list** 
    The first step in any stakeholder engagement plan is to [list the stakeholders](https://www.projectengineer.net/stakeholder-identification-techniques/).  But it’s important to be thorough because it’s easy to underestimate the ability of a minor stakeholder to trip up the project when they’re not being communicated with adequately.  According to the PMBOK, this list is called a [Stakeholder Register](https://www.projectengineer.net/the-parts-of-a-stakeholder-register/), and it is created as part of the Identify Stakeholders process.
*   **Project phase** 
    Many stakeholders will be involved in only a certain phase of the project.
*   **Contact name(s)** 
    It’s important to be in contact with the correct people.  Large organizations or government (regulatory) stakeholders have many layers of bureaucracy which can result in project delays when the primary decision maker is not being communicated with directly.
*   **Areas of Influence** 
    This is where the stakeholder’s “stake” is defined.  How do their interests overlap with the project?  What are their business goals and how does your project interfere with them?  Why is this stakeholder interested in your project?  There can be no meaningful stakeholder engagement without understanding each other’s viewpoints.
*   **Power** 
    Each stakeholder has a unique ability to stop and/or change the project.  What is that ability?  Where does it derive from, and how can it be controlled?  Sometimes the stakeholder’s power over the project can be removed, but this comes at a cost, both monetary and in stakeholder satisfaction (they could become very unhappy and influence other stakeholders).
*   **Engagement approach** 
    The strategy for engaging the stakeholder must be outlined in detail.  The types and frequency of communication, for example weekly emails, monthly phone calls, or weekly face to face meetings.  The content of those communications, for example a weekly update that contains project progress, design information, and open house plans.

How to Develop a Stakeholder Engagement Plan
--------------------------------------------

There are five steps to developing a stakeholder engagement plan:

1.  **Classify Stakeholders** 
    As an initial step in stakeholder analysis, classifying the stakeholders into defined groups can assist in the next, more detailed steps.  Stakeholders can be classified into supporting or opposed, for example a project investor is a supporter and an environmental NGO is opposed.  They can be divided into Upwards/Sideways/Outwards/Downwards, for example, upwards are executives from the parent organization, sideways are project suppliers and contractors, outwards are other projects competing for limited resources and downwards are the project team, suppliers and contractors.
    
    作为涉众分析的第一步，将涉众划分为确定的组有助于下一步更详细的步骤。涉众可以分为支持和反对两种，比如一个项目投资者是支持的，一个环保NGO是反对的。他们可以分为向上/横向/向外/向下，例如，向上是来自母公司的高管，横向是项目供应商和承包商，向外是竞争有限资源的其他项目，向下是项目团队、供应商和承包商。

2. **Develop Power/Interest Grid** 
    This is the primary [stakeholder analysis](https://www.projectengineer.net/how-to-perform-a-stakeholder-analysis/) tool.  It contains the power of the stakeholder on the y-axis, which is the ability of the stakeholder to stop and/or change the project, and the interest level of the stakeholder on the x-axis, which is the amount of overlap the stakeholder’s interests have with the project.  This defines the stakeholder’s “stake” in the project.

    这是主要的[利益相关者分析](https://www.projectengineer.net/how-to-perform-a-stakeholder-analysis/)工具。y轴是涉众的权力，即涉众停止和/或改变项目的能力;x轴是涉众的利益水平，即涉众的利益与项目的重叠程度。这定义了项目涉众的“利害关系”。

3. **Define Power** 
    Although the stakeholder’s location on the chart is important, a verbal analysis of the power of the stakeholder is imperative to get a sense of how much influence the stakeholder has.  For example, a government regulatory agency usually has extremely high power to stop the project – they can withhold their approval and stop the project immediately.  The success of the project is heavily dependent on keeping them informed on an ongoing basis.

    虽然利益相关者在图表上的位置很重要，但对利益相关者的权力进行口头分析是必要的，以了解利益相关者的影响力有多大。例如，政府监管机构通常拥有极高的权力来停止项目——他们可以拒绝批准并立即停止项目。项目的成功很大程度上依赖于让他们随时了解情况。

4. **Define Interest** 
    Once again, the location of the stakeholder on the chart is expanded and analyzed to determine what their interest in the project really is.  The stakeholder’s business interests are analyzed and prioritized.  Their needs and wants are described to a point where the stakeholder is well understood by the project management team.

    再一次，涉众在图上的位置被扩展和分析，以确定他们在项目中真正感兴趣的是什么。对利益相关者的商业利益进行分析和排序。他们的需求和需求被描述到项目管理团队能够很好地理解涉众的程度。

5. **Develop the Stakeholder Engagement Plan** 
    The stakeholder communication needs are itemized based on the power and influence analysis.  The type of communication and its frequency is specified.  The other parts of the stakeholder engagement plan, described above, are more administrative in nature.  

    利益相关者沟通需求在权力和影响力分析的基础上逐项列出。指定通信类型及其频率。利益相关者参与计划的其他部分，如上所述，在本质上更具有管理性。

Importance of Stakeholder Engagement
------------------------------------

The stakeholder engagement plan is the foundation for achieving stakeholder buy-in for the project.

Of course, the plan must be tailored to the size of the project, as with all parts of the [project management plan](https://www.projectengineer.net/project-management-plan-the-12-core-components/).  For the smallest possible project, where one person writes a report for one [project sponsor](https://www.projectengineer.net/what-is-a-project-sponsor/), a written stakeholder engagement plan is probably not necessary.  But the concept is still present – the single stakeholder must be [managed](https://www.projectengineer.net/guide-to-stakeholder-management/) in order to achieve their buy-in.

For large projects, such as mining or infrastructure projects, stakeholder engagement is a major undertaking.  The many stakeholders all have different needs and wants, and their power and interest in the project are all unique, requiring specialized consultation requirements.  The stakeholder engagement plans are given to the project management team, and potentially the parent organization for approval prior to implementation.  The plans are then put into action and the project management team are continuously updated regarding the the status of each stakeholder.

How to Improve Stakeholder Engagement
-------------------------------------

For projects that need it, detailed stakeholder engagement plans are indispensable.  But often the secret to [project success](https://www.projectengineer.net/defining-project-success/) is in the continuous improvement of the stakeholder consultation process rather than in rigid adherence to a plan.  That is, there is a creative component rather than a purely analytical one.

In that spirit, I will outline the following three steps to improve stakeholder engagement for all projects:

1.  **Show the stakeholder you care**  
    Stakeholders understand that someone wants to win them over, and that the organization probably has a plan to do just that.  Believe me, there are many, many projects out there where organizations have engaged stakeholders with an aggressive, empathy-free attitude attempting to strong arm the stakeholder into project approval.  This tends to drive stakeholders further into their trenches and develop their opposition.  Even if you have the power to stop their concerns, they often exercise their right to spread bad word of mouth, which takes enormous amounts of time and money to neutralize.  A little bit of empathy costs nothing, but accomplishes great strides in addressing project opposition.
2.  **Emphasize the human aspect**  
    Private sector projects are undertaken by organizations that hope to enhance their bottom line, to increase their profits.  Government and NGO projects also have goals that sometimes overlap with stakeholders with conflicting interests.  But it’s not only about the money.  Even private sector projects have a societal benefit – the employment of the project staff, that is, the project is a crucial piece in the generation of prosperity to society.  In other words, there are people on both sides.  Project stakeholders should be consulted in a way that communicates the benefits to society rather than purely increasing investor profits.  Of course, some projects might be structured so as to be excessively profit driven at someone else’s expense, in which case the project management team needs to ask themselves if they need to change their plan.
3.  **Give stakeholders a voice**  
    More than anything else, people want to be heard.  It’s amazing what type of transformation takes place when a stakeholder is allowed to voice their concerns and realizes that it’s being heard.  But therein lies the rub.  Most stakeholders are well attuned to the possibility that they will be listened to and ignored.  The transformation occurs when they truly believe that the project management team has considered their concerns and tried very hard to implement them.  And this belief is not accomplished by the development and rigid implementation of a plan.

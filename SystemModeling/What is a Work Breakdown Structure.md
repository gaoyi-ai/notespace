Breaking work into smaller tasks is a common productivity technique used to make the work more manageable and approachable. For projects, the **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** is the tool that utilizes this technique and is one of the most important project management documents. It singlehandedly integrates scope, cost and schedule baselines ensuring that project plans are in alignment.

把工作分解成小任务是一种常见的提高效率的方法，可以让工作更容易管理，更容易完成。对于项目来说，**工作分解结构(WBS)**就是利用这一技术的工具，是最重要的项目管理文件之一。它单独集成范围、成本和进度基线，确保项目计划是一致的。

The Project Management Institute (PMI) Project Management Book of Knowledge (PMBOK) defines the Work Breakdown Structure as a “deliverable oriented hierarchical decomposition of the work to be executed by the project team.” There are two types of WBS: 1) [Deliverable-Based](#wbsdeliverables) and 2) [Phase-Based](#wbsphasebased). The most common and preferred approach is the Deliverable-Based approach. The main difference between the two approaches are the **Elements** identified in the first Level of the WBS.

项目管理协会(PMI)《项目管理知识手册》(PMBOK)将工作分解结构定义为“面向可交付的、由项目团队执行的工作的分层分解”。有两种类型的WBS: 1)[基于交付的](#wbsdeliverables)和2)[基于阶段的](#wbsphasebased)。最常见和首选的方法是基于交付的方法。这两种方法之间的主要区别是在WBS的第一级中确定的**元素。

Deliverable-Based Work Breakdown Structure
------------------------------------------

A Deliverable-Based Work Breakdown Structure clearly demonstrates the relationship between the project deliverables (i.e., products, services or results) and the scope (i.e., work to be executed). Figure 1 is an example of a Deliverable-Based WBS for building a house. Figure 2 is an example of a Phase-Based WBS for the same project.

基于可交付成果的工作分解结构清楚地展示了项目可交付成果(即，产品、服务或结果)和范围(即，要执行的工作)之间的关系。图1是一个用于建造房屋的基于可交付WBS的示例。下图是同一个项目基于阶段的WBS的一个例子。

Figure 1 – Deliverable Based Work Breakdown Structure

In Figure 1, the Level 1 Elements are summary deliverable descriptions. The Level 2 Elements in each Leg of the WBS are all the unique deliverables required to create the respective Level 1 deliverable.

在图1中，Level 1元素是可交付的概要描述。WBS每个分支中的第2级元素都是创建相应的第1级交付物所需的所有唯一交付物。

Phase-Based Work Breakdown Structure
------------------------------------

In Figure 2, a Phase-Based WBS, the Level 1 has five Elements. Each of these Elements are typical phases of a project. The Level 2 Elements are the unique deliverables in each phase. Regardless of the type of WBS, the lower Level Elements are all deliverables. Notice that Elements in different Legs have the same name. A Phase-Based WBS requires work associated with multiple elements be divided into the work unique to each Level 1 Element. A [WBS Dictionary](https://www.workbreakdownstructure.com/wbs-dictionary) is created to describe the work in each Element.

在图2中，一个基于阶段的WBS，级别1有五个元素。这些元素中的每一个都是项目的典型阶段。第2级元素是每个阶段中唯一的可交付成果。不管WBS的类型是什么，低层的元素都是可交付的。注意，不同分支中的元素具有相同的名称。基于阶段的WBS要求将与多个元素相关的工作划分为每个第一级元素特有的工作。创建一个[WBS字典](https://www.workbreakdownstructure.com/wbs-dictionary)来描述每个元素中的工作。

Figure 2 - Phase Based Work Breakdown Structure

A good WBS is simply one that makes the project more manageable. Every project is different; every project manager is different and every WBS is different. So, the right WBS is the one that best answers the question, “What structure makes the project more manageable?”.

一个好的WBS只是使项目更易于管理。每个项目都是不同的;每个项目经理都是不同的，每个WBS也是不同的。因此，正确的WBS最好地回答了这个问题，“什么样的结构使项目更易于管理?”

How to Make a Work Breakdown Structure
--------------------------------------

A good Work Breakdown Structure is created using an iterative process by following these steps and meeting these guidelines:

1.  Gather Critical Documents
    1.  Gather critical project documents.
    2.  Identify content containing project deliverables, such as the Project Charter, Scope Statement and Project Management Plan (PMP) subsidiary plans.
2.  Identify Key Team Members
    1.  Identify the appropriate project team members.
    2.  Analyze the documents and identify the deliverables.
3.  Define Level 1 Elements
    1.  Define the Level 1 Elements. Level 1 Elements are summary deliverable descriptions that must capture 100% of the project scope.
    2.  Verify 100% of scope is captured. This requirement is commonly referred to as the [100% Rule](https://www.workbreakdownstructure.com/100-percent-rule-work-breakdown-structure).
4.  Decompose (Breakdown) Elements
    1.  Begin the process of breaking the Level 1 deliverables into unique lower Level deliverables. This “breaking down” technique is called Decomposition.
    2.  Continue breaking down the work until the work covered in each Element is managed by a single individual or organization. Ensure that all Elements are mutually exclusive.
    3.  Ask the question, would any additional decomposition make the project more manageable? If the answer is “no”, the WBS is done.
5.  Create WBS Dictionary
    1.  Define the content of the [WBS Dictionary](https://www.workbreakdownstructure.com/wbs-dictionary). The WBS Dictionary is a narrative description of the work covered in each Element in the WBS. The lowest Level Elements in the WBS are called Work Packages.
    2.  Create the WBS Dictionary descriptions at the [Work Package](#wbsworkpackages) Level with detail enough to ensure that 100% of the project scope is covered. The descriptions should include information such as, boundaries, milestones, risks, owner, costs, etc.
6.  Create Gantt Chart Schedule
    1.  Decompose the Work Packages to activities as appropriate.
    2.  Export or enter the Work Breakdown Structure into a [Gantt chart](https://www.gantt.com/) for further scheduling and project tracking.

**Caution:** It is possible to break the work down too much. How much is too much? Since cost and schedule data collection, analysis and reporting are connected to the WBS, a very detailed WBS could require a significant amount of unnecessary effort to manage.

把工作分解得太多是可能的。多少算是太多?由于成本和进度数据收集、分析和报告都与WBS相连，一个非常详细的WBS可能需要大量不必要的工作来管理。

How to Use a Work Breakdown Structure
-------------------------------------

The Work Breakdown Structure is used for many different things. Initially, it serves as a planning tool to help the project team plan, define and organize scope with deliverables. The WBS is also used as the primary source of schedule and cost estimate activities. But, its biggest contributions to a project are is use as a description all of the work and as a monitoring and controlling tool.

工作分解结构用于许多不同的事情。最初，它作为一个计划工具，帮助项目团队计划、定义和组织可交付成果的范围。WBS也被用作进度和成本估计活动的主要来源。但是，它对项目最大的贡献是将其用作所有工作的描述以及监视和控制工具。

**Work Packages**

Figure 3 shows the House Project Work Breakdown Structure expanded to Level 1, 2, and 3 Elements. The lowest Levels of each Leg and Branch of the WBS are called **Work Packages**. Work Packages cover information related to the deliverable, such as owner, milestones, durations, resources, risks, etc. This information is described in the WBS Dictionary.

图3显示了House项目工作分解结构扩展到级别1、2和3的元素。WBS的每个分支和分支的最低层次称为**工作包**。工作包涵盖了与可交付内容相关的信息，例如所有者、里程碑、持续时间、资源、风险等。这个信息在WBS字典中有描述。

**Planning Packages**

There is another type of Work Package called a **Planning Package**. When the project management plan is approved, scope is known, but not necessarily all of the details. In order to apply the [100% Rule](https://www.workbreakdownstructure.com/100-percent-rule-work-breakdown-structure) and capture all of the scope, Planning Packages are created. It is understood that as details are defined, the Planning Packages eventually evolve to Work Packages. In the House Project, the project manager knows that the house will have fixtures, but at the time construction begins, there is only a fixture allowance and no fixtures identified. Once the fixtures are determined, the associated Planning Package becomes a Work Package. This planning process is call Rolling Wave Planning and is a from of Progressive Elaboration.

还有一种工作包叫做“计划包”。当项目管理计划被批准时，范围是已知的，但不一定是所有的细节。为了应用[100%规则](https://www.workbreakdownstructure.com/100-percent-rule-work-breakdown-structure)并捕获所有的范围，需要创建计划包。可以理解的是，随着细节的定义，计划包最终演变为工作包。在房屋项目中，项目经理知道房屋将会有固定装置，但在施工开始时，只有固定装置津贴，没有确定固定装置。一旦确定了夹具，相关的计划包就变成了一个工作包。这一规划过程称为滚动波规划，是一个逐步细化的过程。

Figure 3 – WBS Work Packages and Control Accounts

**Control Accounts**

The other application of the WBS is as a monitoring and controlling tool. This is accomplished by defining Control Accounts. Control Accounts are WBS Elements at which the project plans to monitor and report performance. The Control Accounts can be any Element in the WBS.
WBS的另一个应用是作为监测和控制工具。这是通过定义控制帐户来完成的。控制帐户是WBS的组成部分，项目计划在此监控和报告绩效。控制帐户可以是WBS中的任何元素。

In the House Project, the project manager decides that the project risks associated with using subcontractors can be better managed if the project reports performance for each subcontractor. To monitor their performance, Elements 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 have been identified as Control Accounts. However, the remaining work in Elements 1.0 and 2.0 will be performed by company resources with less risk and the project does not feel like monitoring and controlling is needed at lower Levels. To assist with the monitoring and reporting, project management information tools are used to collect, analyze and report information at any Element within the WBS.

A [Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/features/breakdown-structure-diagram-tool/) is a deliverable-oriented hierarchical decomposition of the work to be executed by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables. A WBS is the cornerstone of effective project planning, execution, controlling, monitoring, and reporting. All the work contained within the WBS is to be identified, estimated, scheduled, and budgeted.

[工作分解结构(WBS)](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/features/breakdown-structure-diagram-tool/)是一个面向可交付的工作的分层分解，由项目团队执行，以完成项目目标并创建所需的可交付成果。WBS是有效的项目计划、执行、控制、监视和报告的基石。WBS中包含的所有工作都要被识别、估计、安排和预算。

Work Breakdown Structure Diagram
--------------------------------

The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is developed to establish a common understanding of project scope. It is a hierarchical description of the work that must be done to complete the deliverables of a project. Each descending level in the WBS represents an increasingly detailed description of the project deliverables.

开发工作分解结构(WBS)是为了建立对项目范围的共同理解。它是对完成项目可交付成果所必须完成的工作的分级描述。WBS中每一个下降的层次都代表着对项目可交付成果越来越详细的描述。

The first two levels of the WBS (the root node and Level 2) define a set of planned outcomes that collectively and exclusively represent 100% of the project scope. At each subsequent level, the children of a parent node collectively and exclusively represent 100% of the scope of their parent node.

WBS的前两个级别(根节点和第2级)定义了一组计划的结果，它们共同且独占地代表了项目范围的100%。在随后的每个级别上，父节点的子节点集体地、独占地代表其父节点的100%范围。

下面是一个工作分解结构的例子:

![](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/servlet/editor-content/guide/project-management/what-is-work-breakdown-structure/sites/7/2018/12/01-work-breakdown-structure-example.png)

Quality of a Work Breakdown Structures
--------------------------------------

A well-designed WBS describes planned outcomes instead of planned actions. Outcomes are the desired ends of the project, such as a product, result, or service, and can be predicted accurately. Actions, on the other hand, may be difficult to predict accurately. A well-designed WBS makes it easy to assign elements of the WBS to any project activity. 

一个设计良好的WBS描述的是计划好的结果，而不是计划好的行动。结果是项目期望的结果，如产品、结果或服务，并且可以准确地预测。另一方面，行动可能很难准确预测。一个设计良好的WBS可以很容易地将WBS的元素分配给任何项目活动。

A good WBS should exhibit the following characteristics:

*   Definable—can be described and easily understood by project participants.
*   Manageable—a meaningful unit of work where specific responsibility and authority can be assigned to a responsible individual.
*   Estimateable—duration can be estimated in time required to complete, and cost can be estimated in resources required to complete.
*   Independent—minimum interface with or dependence on other ongoing elements (i.e., assignable to a single control account, and clearly distinguishable from other work packages).
*   Integratable—integrates with other project work elements and with higher level cost estimates and schedules to include the entire project.
*   Measurable—can be used to measure progress; has start and completion dates and measurable interim milestones.
*   Adaptable—sufficiently flexible so the addition/elimination of work scope can be readily accommodated in the WBS framework.

Guidelines for Developing Work Breakdown Structure
--------------------------------------------------

The development of Work Breakdown Structure involves subdividing the major project activities or sub-activities into smaller, more manageable activities until the activities are defined in sufficient detail to support the management and development of project works. The items at the lowest level of a branch are known as work packages.

工作分解结构的发展包括将主要项目活动或子活动细分为更小、更易于管理的活动，直到这些活动被足够详细地定义，以支持项目工作的管理和发展。位于分支最低层次的项被称为工作包。

Here are some tips in developing a Work Breakdown Structure that can express works effectively:

1.  Always express Work Breakdown Structure activities at the lowest levels of granularity in verb form.
2.  Review the Work Breakdown Structure. Make sure all deliverables have been fully covered by the works defined in the Work Breakdown Structure.
3.  Ensure that testing and training have been taken into account.
4.  Ensure that non-IT work packages are also included such as, documentation and review activities are included in the structure.
5.  Ensure that other supporting activities such as, product/service launch and implementation activities are planned.
6.  Ensure that delivery approval cycles are taken into account.
7.  Include project management deliverables on the project as well (e.g. production of Project Plan). Include any deliverables that must be met or delivered by the customer or any external parties. Check the Work Breakdown Structure against the project approach specified in Project Charter for any activities that needs to be included in the Work Breakdown Structure.

1.  总是以动词的形式在粒度最低的级别表达工作分解结构活动。
2.  检查工作分解结构。确保所有可交付成果都被工作分解结构中定义的工作完全覆盖。
3.  确保将测试和培训考虑在内。
4.  确保非it工作包也包括在内，例如，文档和审查活动包括在结构中。
5.  确保计划其他支持活动，如产品/服务的推出和实施活动。
6.  确保交付批准周期被考虑在内。
7.  包括项目管理的可交付成果(如项目计划的制作)。包括客户或任何外部方必须满足或交付的任何交付物。根据项目章程中指定的项目方法检查工作分解结构，以确定需要包含在工作分解结构中的任何活动。

Different Forms of Work Breakdown Structure
-------------------------------------------

Generally speaking, there are three typical ways in structuring works with a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). They includes phase-based structures, deliverable-based structures and responsibility-based structures.

### Phase-based structures

Define and structure project activities based on the project phases.

![](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/servlet/editor-content/guide/project-management/what-is-work-breakdown-structure/sites/7/2018/12/02-phase-based-work-breakdown-structure.png)

### Deliverable-based structures

Define and structure project activities based on the deliverables agreed to deliver.

![](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/servlet/editor-content/guide/project-management/what-is-work-breakdown-structure/sites/7/2018/12/03-deliverable-based-work-breakdown-structure.png)

### Responsibility-based structure

Define and structure project activities based on the organization units that will work on the project.

![](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/servlet/editor-content/guide/project-management/what-is-work-breakdown-structure/sites/7/2018/12/04-responsibility-based-work-breakdown-structure.png)

Other Use Cases of Breakdown Structure
--------------------------------------

Typical use of breakdown structure as a project management tool includes Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Resource Breakdown Structure, Risk Breakdown Structure and Organization Breakdown Structure (OBS), or sometimes known as Organization Chart.

### Resource Breakdown Structure

Resource Breakdown Structure (RBS) is a project management tool that provides a hierarchical decomposition of resources, either structured by resource category, types or by IT/business function that has resource needs.

Here is a Resource Breakdown Structure example:

![](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/servlet/editor-content/guide/project-management/what-is-work-breakdown-structure/sites/7/2018/12/05-resource-breakdown-structure-example.png)

### Risk Breakdown Structure

Risks are everything in any IT project. The existence of risk causes negative impact on project schedule, costs and quality. In project management, Project Manager is responsible for managing risks and to ensure that the project will be delivered on time, within project and up to the standard user expected. One of the popular risk management tool is the Risk Breakdown Structure.

Risk breakdown Structure is the hierarchical decomposition of risks, starting from the root node element that represents the project, and going down to the various risk categories, and then finer level risks.

Besides presenting project risks in a Risk Breakdown Structure, it is possible to combine the use of Color Legend in representing the impact of risk. Take a look at the Risk Breakdown Structure example below, a legend of Impact with five items has been setup, representing the five levels of impacts that risks may have on the project with five distinct color code.

Here is a Risk Breakdown Structure example:

![](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/servlet/editor-content/guide/project-management/what-is-work-breakdown-structure/sites/7/2018/12/06-risk-breakdown-structure-example.png)

### Organizational Breakdown Structure

Organizational Breakdown Structure, or sometimes known as Organization Chart, is a widely used project management tool for representing project organization. It typically begins with the project sponsor, and with all key stakeholders included. In presenting the organization structure, consider the organization or group that is requesting the project and the level of their sponsorship and authority.

Here is an Organizational Breakdown Structure example:
